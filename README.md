# MCDS
MCDS = Multimodal Classsification Dataset Simulator


To benchmark various classification machine learning algorithms, a "gold standard" is needed. MCS, is intended to simulate datasets with several features; initially the intent is a binary classification and with time it will extend to multiple lables.
